# Class-Projects
Shows my contributions in class projects in Syracuse University
I have removed most of my classmates' work in these files. I uploaded the work I did before I put it into the group code.

### Greedy Algorithm
* This group project helps illustrate the differences between algorithms, using a simulation.
* I created the code to help illustrate the greedy algorithm
 
### Quarters and Dimes Game 
* A ECS final where I replicate an IRL game, Quarters and Dimes, with two other members
* Our version of the game is Player vs AI
* My teammates helped create the thinking behind the AI while I linked up its thoughts into actions.

* We learned that Quarters and Dimes is a "solved" game. This means that if a player is skilled at the game, it is almost guarenteed that the player wins or draws the game.
* My teammates figured out a way to replicate that effect by making a table
* I logged player actions and looked at the table to find the best move.
* This way of implementing would mean that each game would result in a draw or a lost, which isn't fun. That's why the Ai would make a mistake once in a while.
  
### Intro to AI final
* A final project where I have to make a search algorithm (the AI) from scratch to predict the most probable sentence
* The professor had provided the tools to help me predict the next word
** I made 2 versions of a tree, using the next word as the nodes, and then using a search algorithm to find the most probable sentence.

* I was tasked to look at the AI algorithms the class has learned and choose 2 that would produce the most probable string of words.
** Queue Search, Iterative Deepening, Minimax, MCTS, MDP, TRL, Gradient Descent, Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and Automated Reasoning
* I chose to do MCTS and Iterative Deepening. If you run the file right now, it'll run the Iterative deepening version.
